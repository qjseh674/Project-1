    <h2>History of Pong</h2>
      <Article>
        <p>
            Pong was one of the earliest arcade video games.
            It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple
            two dimensional graphics.The game was originally
            manufactured by Atari.Pong was one of the first
            video games to reach mainstream popularity.
            Allan Alcorn created Pong as a training exercise
            assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell.
            Nolan Bushnell had an idea on an electronic ping-pong
            game included in the MagnavoxOdyssey which later resulted
            in a lawsuit against Atari. Pong quickly became a success
            and is the first commercially successful arcade video game
            machine,which helped establish the video game industry along
            with the first home console.<br>

    <h2>History of Atari</h2>
      <article>
        <p>
            The original Atari Inc. was founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell
            and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles,
            and home computers. The original Atari Inc. was split due to its role in
            the video game crash of 1983, and the arcade division was turned into
            Atari Games Inc. Atari Games received the rights to use the logo and
            brand name with appended text “Games” on arcade games as well as rights to
            the original 1972-1982 arcade hardware properties. The Atari Consumer Electronics
            Division properties were in turn sold to Jack Tramiel’s Tramel Technology Ltd.,
            which then renamed itself to Atari Corporation. In 1998, 6 November Hasbro
            Interactive acquired all Atari Corporation related properties from JTS creating
            a new subsidiary, Atari <br>

    <h2> History of SpaceWar</h2>
        <article>
          <p>
             Space war is a space combat video game developed on 1962 as one of the first games
              created in the early history of video games. It was initially designed by
              Steve Russell, in collaboration with Marin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen, and
              programmed by Russell with the assistance from others including Bob Saunders and
              Steve Piner. It was written for the newly installed Digital Equipment Corporation
              PDP-1 minicomputer at the Massachusetts institute of Technology. After it initial
              Creation Space war was expanded further by other students and employees of universities
              in the area, including Dan Edwards and Peter Samson. The game features two spaceships,
              “the needle” and “the wedge”, engaged in a dogfight while maneuvering in the gravity well
              of a star. Both ships are controlled by human players and this was a big step for the world
              of technology and gaming. Space war was extremely popular in the small programming community
              in the 1960s and was widely ported to other computer systems at the time. It directly inspired
              many other electronic games, such as the first commercial arcade games Galaxy game and Computer
              Space (1971), and the later games such as Asteroids. In 2007 Spacewar was named to a list of the
              10 most important video games of all time, which formed the start of the game canon at the Library
              of Congress.<br>
